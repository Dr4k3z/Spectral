# Spectral
Selft-written linear algebra library for C++. The library has been compiled using Visual C++ 2022; unfortunately this means that it can't be linked in projects that use other compilers. I'm currently working on making it cross platform. If you wish to use my library in an environment different from Visual Studio, I suggest compiling the files yourself. To link the library in visual studio, follow the usual step used to import a static library, which you can find for instance at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4445418/how-to-add-additional-libraries-to-visual-studio-project.

Many features are currently under development, if you wish to contribute please feel free to fork the repository or contact me on my Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-campagnoli-3a515b1bb/. I feel the need to thanks the guys at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/, from whom I took inspiration to write the matrix rank algorithm .

In the tutorial folder you may find some explanatory examples, which go over the various aspects of the library. Moreover, I've uploaded I little project that applies the library to a computer graphics application.

Thanks a lot for the attention, I hope you'll appreciate the effort I put in. Enjoy
