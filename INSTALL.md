The source code is contained in the folder Spectral. To compile it in Visual Studio, you may use the .sln file in the current directory. If you wish to use another compiler, 
import the source code mentioned above. 

If you don't want to compile at all, you can use the .lib file right away. However, you'll need to download the header files too.
